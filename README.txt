Hello!

LadderManager is a bot maintained by discord user Antis#4219. Since he's poor and can't afford to rent a server, people need to host the bot on their own computer/server.


SETUP:
0. download python 3.6.7
1. download discord.py 1.0.0, setup your discord bot account --> https://pythonprogramming.net/discordpy-basic-bot-tutorial-introduction/
2. download and unzip the files here and put them all into the same folder
3. Add your discord bot token to dynamic_options.py.
4. Change dynamic_options.py to match your preferences.
5. Invite the bot to your server:
permission integer: 67584

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=()&scope=bot&permissions=67584

Replace the () in the above link with your bot's ID and use the link to invite the bot to your server.

6. Run the ladder_manager_main.py file to run the bot.

Message Antis#4219 if there are any issues.
